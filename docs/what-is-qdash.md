## Concept

To improve the accuracy of the calibration of qubits, it is necessary to consolidate and analyze all the information related to it.
We believe that automatic management and analysis of when and in what settings the results were obtained can contribute to improving the accuracy of calibration, and QDash is a platform for this purpose.

## Key Features

To achieve the above objectives, QDash provides the following functions

- **‚ö° Workflows**: Centrally manage and track the progress of calibration workflows, from creation to completion.

- **üìä Observations**: Access and analyze the observational data utilized in calibration processes, ensuring transparency and insight.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Settings**: Configure calibration parameters and adjust workflow settings to meet specific requirements seamlessly.
